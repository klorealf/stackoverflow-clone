Our MVP strives for two different main goals. First, if not logged in an unidentified user can see the board of questions and view questions, and answer from that board. If logged in a user can also view the question board, but can also create questions and answer questions. After achieivng our MVP we look to add the comments (Cs) to both the questions (Qs) and answers (As). Once Cs are added, with join tables to Qs and As, then we can add the dynamic, crowdsource, that will create a connection between Cs, Qs, and As as well as adding a structure to our display.



**Note**: This branch (master) contains a skeleton without any app code, perfect for creating a _new_ application or challenge. If you're looking for an example app built with this skeleton, take a look at the [example](/../..//tree/example) branch which includes basic CRUD and RSpec tests.

### Purpose
The Sinatra Skeleton:

1. Provides a foundation for building challenges or creating a new Sinatra application.
2. Demonstrates a reasonable set of practices around building Sinatra applications.
3. Eases the transition to Rails for Dev Bootcamp students

### Quickstart

1.  `bundle install`
2.  `shotgun config.ru`

As needed, create models & migrations with the `rake` tasks:

```
rake generate:migration  # Create an empty migration in db/migrate, e.g., rake generate:migration NAME=create_tasks
rake generate:model      # Create an empty model in app/models, e.g., rake generate:model NAME=User
```

We would love for you to help make the skeleton more awesome, There are three ways to contribute:

1. Ask for a bug fix or enhancement!
2. Submit a pull request for a bug fix or enhancement!
3. Code review an open pull request!
